    <div class="container">                <h2><em>What Exactly is It?</em></h2>
<img src="images/wearedreamers.jpg" alt="** PLEASE DESCRIBE THIS IMAGE **">
 
<p>Generation Y refers to anyone who was born between the mid 1980's to the early 2000's (ie. when Disney Channel was actually good.) They are the beloved children of the baby boomers, the light at the end of the tunnel, the world's futu- okay sorry, the narcissist in me went a little overboard. Generation Y has been estimated to be as large as 70 million people and have experienced some of the most drastic changes in history. This generation spans across the birth of a new era: The Digital Age.<br></p>
<div id="sidebar"> <ol> <em><ol class="c1">Fun Facts about Millennials</ol></em>    <li>1/3 of millennials use the internet as their primary source of news.</li>    <li>Millennials are also referred to as Generation Y, Generation 9/11, Echo Boomers, or the Global Generation.</li>    <li>Overall, Gen Y is considered the most ambitious of all the generations.</li>    <li>65% believe in same-sex marriage.</li>    <li>They are the fastest growing and largest segment of today's workforce.</li>    <li> By 2025, Millennials will make up about 75% of the US workforce.</li>    <li>Millennials account for 1 trillion in consumer spending.</li>    <li>Millenials are more progressive and accepting when it comes to social issues than previous generations (47% vs. 19%)</li>    <li> More than a quarter (27%) are self employed.</li>    <li> 6 out of 10 Millenials work full time.</li> </ol> </div><!-- end sidebar -->
<h2>But are We Really <em>That</em> Bad?</h2> <p>When you look up Generation Y, you probably didn't read the most pleasant of facts about this generation. Some common misconceptions of millennial is that they're lazy, selfish, and constantly in need of affection. Millennial have a short attention span, making them unable to focus on any given subject for long. While there are a few people that give millennial a bad reputation; it is safe to say that not all of them mimic those stereotypes.</p> <h3>We're tech-savvy:</h3> <blockquote cite="http://www.warc.com/Pages/NewsAndOpinion/Quotebank.aspx?Category=Digital">"We have technology, finally, that for the first time in human history allows people to really maintain rich connections with much larger numbers of people." -Pierre Omidyar,founder, eBay</blockquote> <p>A more positive outlook on this generation describes us in quite a different fashion. The Digital Age gave birth to the kind of connection between people that had never existed before. Generation Y adapted to this and became known for their tech savvy-ness. Today it is very common to see any teenager or young adult glued to their phone, whether for work or personal reasons. Lecture presentations have now been modified to fit the rise of technology. According to studies done in 2010, it revealed that 96% of undergraduates own a cell phone,check their emails,texts, and social media through their phones as well. Many people mistake that to mean that this generation is impatient when in reality they just recognize more efficient and speedier ways to get things done.</p> <h3>We value Feedback:</h3> <p>The world seems to love taking shots at the incoming generation. Dubbing Generation Y as the "trophy generation" Time Magazine was no different. Compared to older generations, Gen Y wants more. In fact, according to studies cited by Time Magazine's notorious "Me, Me, Me" article, 40% of Gen Y believe that they should be promoted every two years regardless of performance. However, what previous generations might look upon a constant need for attention and praise is quite different from the reality. While praise and rewards are valued, so is constructive criticism. Millennial are constantly looking for a way to better themselves (which is sometimes mistakenly interpreted as being self absorbed). And as accordingly, they require feedback (whether good or bad) as an incentive to accomplish their goals. The desire to see the fruits of one's labor should not be viewed as a negative thing. These desires are what makes Generation Y so hardworking.</p> <h3>We're Ambitious and it Scares People </h3> <p>"They're just a bunch of dreamers, their heads are always in the clouds." This is just one of the many phrases millenials have had to hear during their lifetime. Millenials don't give up just because they hear that their dreams might be hard to reach, instead, they fight harder. It's not that this generation is unhappy with what they are given, it is that they know they can do better. And this new age has paved the way to do just that. TV shows like Project Runway and American Idol have helped millenials get the exposure they need to become the next Michael Costello or Kelly Clarkson. YouTube and Vine created present stars like Justin Bieber, Us the Duo, and Fred. Professions that had at one point seemed impossible to reach are now accessible. Now, thousands of millenials are pouring into the job market looking for a profession that not only pays the bills but is also what they love. It's that kind of determination that scares people. The way they are willing to push the limits and question authority and ones way of thinking, or jump into risky situations if there is but a <em>chance</em> of success has never been so valiantly displayed in a generation before. Generation Y is a generation of artists, journalists, and entrepreneurs- and no one is going to stop them.</p> <h3>We are Diverse. We are Accepting.</h3> <p>Generation Y is the most accepting out of any generation. Through their hard work they have helped push women's,gay, and minority rights to the forefront of people's minds. They They are also the most ethnically and racially diverse individuals in the nations history. According to studies, between the ages of 13 and 29, 18.5% are Hispanic, 14.2% are black, 4.3 are Asian, and 3.2% are of mixed race (Pew Research).
